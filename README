asm - ARM assembly instruction emulator
=======================================

Work in progress ARM architecture instruction emulator.

Currently supported:
- Arithemtic operators.
- Branch and branch with link instructions.
- Bitwise operators.
- Conditional flags and execution of instructions.
- Data movement instructions.
- Load / store instructions without shifts.
- PUSH / POP instructions.
- Set flag instruction suffix.
- TST and TEQ instructions.

To be completed:
- Generate label addresses on first parsing pass.
- Limit what immediate values can be loaded in operand 2 (8-bit value rotated right by an even number of bits between 0-30).
- Support for different execution types.
- Support for all shifting types (ASR, LSR, ROR, RRX, etc.).
- Shifting for the "OP{S}{cond} Rd, Op2" and "op{cond}{S} Rd, Rn, Op2" instruction types.
